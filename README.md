# Data_Cleaning_Project
I tried to clean a raw dataset using MySQL for my first project on GitHub.
I did my best, but I may have made some mistakes. 
I'm still new at this, so please understand.

First, we insert the raw data into the SQL database. 
The raw data is a CSV file that contains information about customers.

Now I am deleting duplicate entries from the table. This will ensure that each customer appears only once in the table.

I standardized the data by changing the format of the date data type. 
This makes it easier to work with the data and ensure that it is consistent.

I am deleting null data for finally cleaning the data. This ensures that the data is complete and consistent.
